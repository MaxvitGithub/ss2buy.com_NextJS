# ss2buy.com Next.js

This repository contains a minimal [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) setup. The project structure was generated manually because the environment did not allow installing packages directly from npm.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires internet access):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `pages/index.js` – main page returning a simple welcome message.
- `package.json` – project metadata and scripts for running Next.js.
